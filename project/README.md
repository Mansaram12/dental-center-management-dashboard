## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mansaram12/dental-center-management.git
   cd dental-center-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

### Environment Setup
No environment variables required - the application uses localStorage for data persistence.

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### State Management Choice
**Decision:** React Context API over Redux
**Reasoning:** 
- Simpler setup for application scope
- No external dependencies required
- Sufficient for the data complexity
- Better TypeScript integration
- Easier testing and debugging

### Styling Approach
**Decision:** Tailwind CSS with custom design system
**Reasoning:**
- Rapid development with utility classes
- Consistent design tokens
- Smaller bundle size than component libraries
- Easy responsive design implementation
- Custom color palette for brand consistency

### Data Storage Strategy
**Decision:** localStorage with structured data models
**Reasoning:**
- Meets assignment requirements (no backend)
- Persistent across browser sessions
- Easy to implement CRUD operations
- Supports file upload simulation
- Realistic data relationships

### Component Architecture
**Decision:** Functional components with hooks
**Reasoning:**
- Modern React best practices
- Better performance with React 18
- Cleaner code organization
- Easier testing
- Better TypeScript support

### Routing Strategy
**Decision:** React Router with protected routes
**Reasoning:**
- Industry standard for React applications
- Built-in route protection
- Clean URL structure
- Easy navigation management
- SEO-friendly routing

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **File Storage:** Files are stored as base64 in localStorage (size limitations)
2. **Data Persistence:** Data is browser-specific (not shared across devices)
3. **Search Functionality:** Basic search implementation in header (placeholder)
4. **Calendar View:** Placeholder implementation (not fully functional)
5. **Real-time Updates:** No real-time synchronization between sessions

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Advanced calendar view with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Real-time notifications
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Data export functionality
- [ ] Print-friendly views
- [ ] Advanced file management
- [ ] Email notifications simulation
- [ ] Advanced reporting and analytics

## 🧪 Testing Approach

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Authentication Flow:**
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Login with patient credentials
   - Logout functionality
   - Route protection validation

2. **Admin Functionality:**
   - Dashboard data display
   - Patient management operations
   - Incident tracking
   - File upload simulation

3. **Patient Functionality:**
   - Personal dashboard access
   - Appointment viewing
   - Profile information display

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - Mobile device compatibility
   - Tablet layout optimization
   - Desktop experience

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- **Code Splitting:** Route-based code splitting with React.lazy
- **Bundle Optimization:** Vite's built-in optimizations
- **Image Optimization:** Responsive images and lazy loading
